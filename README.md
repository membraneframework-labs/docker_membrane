### Version selection

These images contain multiple Erlang and Elixir versions, managed with [asdf]. You can specify which one should be selected by running: `asdf global erlang <version>` or `asdf global elixir <version>` in your script.

### Default versions:

| Image  | Erlang | Elixir |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| focal  | 23.3.1 | 1.11.3 |
| bionic | 22.2   | 1.9.4  |

## Building the image

To rebuild the image, run the following command:

```sh
make build
```

Optionally, one can add the following variables:
* `VERSION=string`, which adds the variant tag. Set to `latest` by default.
* `FLAVOR=string`, which selects the flavor (subdirectory of this repository) to build. Set to `focal` by default.
* `IMAGE=name`, which will override the default image name. If not specified, this is set to `membrane/membrane`

## Sample usage

Execute the following command while being in your application directory:

```sh
make run
```

or from anywhere:

```sh
DIR=/my/app/directory make run
```

This will start the container with the application directory mapped to `/app`. Inside the container, go to that directory:

```sh
cd /app
```

and execute your app's code (for example tests)
```sh
mix test
```
